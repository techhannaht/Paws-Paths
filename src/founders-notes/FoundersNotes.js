                        Bean and Froggie have always been more than just pets to me; they're family. Our daily walks together brought us closer and filled our lives with joy. It was during these walks that the idea for Paws&Paths began to take shape.

                        I wanted to share the incredible experience of dog walking with other dog owners and their four-legged friends. The happiness and health benefits that walking brought to Bean and Froggie's lives had to be shared with the world. And so, Paws&Paths was born.

                        Paws&Paths isn't just an app; it's a labor of love. It's a way for dog owners to document their walks with their dogs, whether to remeber a fond memory or to note reminders about routes to keep their pup safe. With my two beloved pups as my inspiration, I've created a platform that encourages the idea that every dog deserves the care and exercise they need to live their happiest and healthiest lives.

                        Join us on this journey as we celebrate the bonds between dogs and their owners, promote healthier and happier lifestyles for our furry friends, and make every walk an unforgettable adventure. Whether it's Bean, Froggie, or your own cherished furry friend, Paws&Paths is here to make every walk a moment to remember. - Hannah Thompson, Founder of Paws&Paths üêæüíó
